<section id="first_sec" class="sections">Football was introduced to Spain by students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza. They included several Oxbridge graduates. In 1895, they founded the club Football goal, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, this club split into two different won the first of four consecutive Copa del Rey titles, which were, at that time, the only statewide competition.In 1912, they moved to their first ground called Campo de O'Donnell after moving between some minor grounds.In 1920, the club's name was changed into Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII, a reputed football fan, granted the title of real ("royal" in English) to the club. When the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed in 1931, however, the club dropped both the word Real and the royal crown from the emblem, being known from then on and until the end of the Spanish Civil War as Madrid C.F. only. The addition of the purple band to the emblem dates back to the Republican period and has remained there ever since.In 1937, due to the stagnation of the Civil War, all activity disappeared and the club virtually ceased to exist.

<section id="fourth_sec" class="sections">During most home matches the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season ticket holders, of which there are average of 68,670.

<p>For some, the greatest player in Madrid’s history, Alfredo Di Stéfano is the player most responsible for establishing Los Blancos’s connection with the Champions League. Aside from his obvious goalscoring ability and his tendency to score in big games (scored 1 or more goals in every single European Cup Final), what goes most unnoticed is his versatility. Capable of playing in attack, midfield, and defense, Di Stéfano adjusted to whatever his team needed him to be and was the man that made his side tick. He ended his illustrious career with 2 Ballon d’ors, 5 European Cups, and 8 La Liga titles. There will never again be a player like this man and the deserves to be known as one of the greatest footballers of all time.</p>

<p>Arriving as an old (he was 31 years of age when signed) and overweight man from Honved Budapest, fans did not expect great things from the Hungarian. Oh how wrong they were. Not only did he amass one of the greatest goal to game ratios in footballing history, but he also led Madrid to 5 La Ligas and 3 European Cups. His extraordinary eye for goal and ability on the ball has made him a legend for anyone who knows an ounce of Madrid’s history, but he remains strangely an unknown to anyone not a fan of The Whites. While he probably deserves to be talked about in the same breath as Pele and Maradona, he will have to do with being considered as one of the best players in Madrid's history.</p>

<p>Explaining why Gento is on this list really takes only 1 number and two words: 6 European Cups. On the other hand, explaining his brilliance would probably take a whole book. It think it's best to stick to one paragraph.
Francisco Gento is in the debate for being one of the best left-wingers of all time. He had the pace to rival the modern day Ronaldos and Bales, the dribbling ability to put Messi to shame (or so it is claimed), and a crossing accuracy that would make David Beckham’s jaw drop. Known as the "Storm of the Cantabrian", Gento played alongside the likes of Di Stéfano, Raymond Kopa, and Ferenc Puskas to make Real Madrid the greatest team in the 20th century history.</p>

Most known for his incredible leap and heading prowess, he is also famed for his legendary partnership with the comeback king Juanito. Arriving at the Bernabeu at the mere age of 19, Santillana would go on to win 9 La Liga titles, 4 Spanish Cups, 1 League Cup, and 2 UEFA cups. He retired with only Di Stéfano having scored more than him.</p>

<p>"The Vulture" was one of the most entertaining talents in European footballing history. His famed trickery and ball control was mind-blowing, and in an age where size ruled, he blew past big defenders with ease. Aside from his incredible technical skills and improvisational abilities, he also possessed a lethal touch. Not often the main striker in the squad, he still managed to win the Pichichi trophy and amass more than 150 goals. He also led the famous "Quinta del Buitre" (The Vulture Squadron), which was one of Madrid’s greatest generations of footballers. They consisted of the likes of Míchel, Manolo Sanchís, Martin Vázquez, and Pardeza and helped Butragueño win a truly ridiculous haul of 15 trophies.</p>

<p>Genius. Magician. Mercurial. These are just some of the words one thinks of when hearing the name Zidane. In fact, one might even say that putting Zidane in the same sentence as those words is a compliment to those adjectives! Such brilliance is not an exaggeration, and he is easily one of world football’s most technically gifted players of all time. He was an absolute delight to watch, as he possessed the world’s best first touch and an uncanny ability to execute "roulettes" (which he popularized). His artistry on the pitch was not just for mere show however, as he scored a brilliant volleyed goal against Bayer Leverkusen to win Real Madrid "La Novena". Now working for Madrid’s Castilla side as a coach, many dream of the day when the French genius can step up and take charge of the first team.</p>

<p>Coming in at number 8, we have one of the most lethal strikers of all time. Ironically starting his youth career off at Atletico Madrid, Raúl quickly showed his golden touch with 13 goals in 7 games for the 1992/1993 youth team. This caught the eye of Jorge Valdano, who then fast-tracked Raúl to the first team. From there on, Raúl only achieved greatness. He went on to win 6 La Liga titles and an incredible 3 Champions Cups, all the while being Madrid’s captain and top goalscorer. Aside from his obvious instincts, Raúl also possessed an underrated amount of flair and work ethic. While he may not have the same technical abilities as others on this list, he fully deserves his place in the pantheon of Real Madrid legends for his unbelievable eye for goal.</p>

<p>Real Madrid’s official website calls him "the best goalkeeper in our history", and it’s hard to disagree with them. Not only did St. Iker possess lightning reflexes and a one-on-one ability second to none, but he also had the humility, composure, and leadership qualities that have made him Madrid’s best ever captain. The number of trophies he has lifted is too large to count and needs no re-telling. While his spat with Mourinho and his unceremonious departure may weigh on some minds, I think every Madrid fan has a special place in our heart for The Saint.After much speculation about his future, on 11 July 2015, Casillas signed with Portuguese side Porto on a two-year deal with the option of a one-year extension.</p>
